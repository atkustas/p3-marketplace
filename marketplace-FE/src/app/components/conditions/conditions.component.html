        <p>EQUIFAX DEVELOPER PORTAL TERMS OF USE</p>
        <p>Effective Date: July 1, 2018</p>
        <p>Below you will find our Developer Portal Terms of Use when using the Equifax Developer Portal. You can also review our Developer Portal Privacy Policy, which provides information regarding our handling of any personal information that you may provide to us.</p>
        <p>THESE TERMS OF USE CONTAIN THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS UPON WHICH YOU MAY PARTICIPATE AS A REGISTERED EQUIFAX DEVELOPER THROUGH THE DEVELOPER.EQUIFAX.COM WEBSITE (“SITE”) and comprise the following: (i) the terms set forth below, (ii) the terms of use generally applicable to Equifax SERVICES AND products (which can be found here: Equifax.com Terms of Use and Privacy Policy) and (iii) any additional terms applicable to particular APIs (and related content) (collectively the “TERMS”). If you have a Master TEST Agreement (“MTA”) OR OTHER EXECUTED MASTER AGREEMENT with EQUIFAX which conflicts with or expressly overrides these Terms, the language of your MTA will control where the language conflicts with or overrides the language of these Terms.</p>
        <p>Please read the following information carefully before using Equifax’s Developer portal (the “Developer Service”). By clicking the “I ACCEPT” button below and by accessing or using the Developer Service in any manner, you (and the organization you represent, if any) are indicating that you (“Developer” or “you”) have read and agree with the Terms described below and that you will follow all laws, rules and regulations applicable to the use of the Developer Service. If you do not agree with these Terms, please do not use the Developer Service. By accessing or using the Developer Service and the associated licenses, you agree to be bound by these Terms, which terms are effective as of the date you begin using the proprietary developer application programming interface (“API”) and the Data that is available via the API.</p>
        <p>Account and Registration.</p>
        <p>1. Creating an Account.</p>
        <p>You need to use a current Equifax Developer Portal account or create a new Equifax Developer Portal account in order to use the API and other Developer Services. Prior to formal approval of your request to create an Equifax Developer Portal account, you will have to verify your contact information via email. Equifax may withhold approval of your account for any reason. It's your responsibility to keep your password, account credentials, and accounts secure. You should notify Equifax immediately if any unauthorized use, or suspected unauthorized use, of your Equifax account occurs or if any other breach of security occurs. Equifax is not liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with these requirements. As part of setting up an Equifax account, you accept these Terms.</p>
        <p>2. Registration.</p>
        <p>You will be required to provide certain information (e.g., your contact details, description of your product or service, your targeted number of users, etc.) as part of the registration process, to access the API or as part of your continued use of the API. You agree you will update your registration information so that it is always accurate. You are only allowed to register for and use one (1) set of login credentials, unless otherwise permitted by Equifax in writing, including via email.</p>
        <p>3. Accepting these Terms.</p>
        <p>You may use the Equifax API and other Equifax Developer Services only if you have the capacity to form a binding contract with Equifax, and only in compliance with these Terms and all applicable local, domestic, state, national, and international laws, rules and regulations. You represent that you are 18 years of age or over, have the authority and capacity to accept these Terms, and agree to be bound by these Terms. If you open a Equifax account on behalf of a company, organization, or other entity, then (i) “you” includes you and that entity, and (ii) you represent and warrant that you are an authorized representative of the entity with the authority to bind the entity to these Terms, and that you agree to these Terms on the entity’s behalf.</p>
        <p>4. Subsidiaries and Affiliates.</p>
        <p>You agree that Equifax subsidiaries and affiliates may provide the Equifax Developer Services to you on behalf of Equifax and these Terms will govern your relationship with these companies. A company is an “affiliate” of another company if it directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the other company.</p>
        <p>EQUIFAX SITE. License Grant / No Other Rights. Equifax’s API is a web service that allows you to interface with Equifax’s database(s) to access and view “dummy information” for certain services that do not relate to any actual person or entity, including advertising for Equifax or third parties (collectively the “Data”). Subject to these Terms and upon completion of your registration with the Developer Portal, Equifax grants you a revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-assignable, limited license to implement the API in your application so that your application can access and query the Data. In other words, you may develop an application (e.g., a web site, mobile device application, personal computer application) that is designed to access and query the Data solely via Equifax’s API platform. Except as otherwise expressly stated in these Terms, you are not granted any other rights to sublicense, distribute or make available the Data to any third party or to facilitate the distribution or delivery of any Data through your application without appropriate agreement(s) first being executed with Equifax by you and/or the End User(s) (as defined below).</p>
        <p>Granted To End Users. Developer acknowledges and agrees that prior to any access being made available to a third party to an application developed by you and made available via the API, Developer must successfully complete all Equifax-required credentialing documentation. In addition, Developer and Equifax must execute a separate written agreement that will govern the access and availability of an application via the API to third party customers (the “End Users”). You will require your End Users to comply with (and not knowingly enable them to violate) applicable law, regulation, the Terms, and any terms agreed to by the parties in an MTA or otherwise.</p>
        <p>General Requirements and Restrictions. The above license is subject to the following general restrictions:</p>
        <p>you shall not submit any false or misleading information regarding your access and use of the API;</p>
        <p>any application you develop utilizing the API shall be designed to access and use the Data only as authorized by Equifax pursuant to a separate written agreement;</p>
        <p>you shall not access or attempt to access any Equifax database other than through the API;</p>
        <p>you shall not falsify or alter any unique identifier (e.g., API Key (defined below)) in, or assigned to, your application, or otherwise obscure or alter the source of queries coming from your application;</p>
        <p>when requested by Equifax, you shall provide instructions on how Equifax can access any application you have developed utilizing the API;</p>
        <p>if you implement the API in a restricted manner (for example, a password protected web site, an application which requires registration) you shall provide (if requested) Equifax with the ability to access the product or service as a credentialed user;</p>
        <p>you shall not reproduce, modify, distribute, decompile, disassemble, or reverse engineer any portion of the Data or the API in an attempt to re-identify any Data that has been de-identified or aggregated;</p>
        <p>you shall not violate or attempt to violate the security of the API (e.g., accessing a server or account you do not have authorization for; attempting to test, scan, probe, or hack the vulnerability of the API or any network used by the API; attempting to circumvent any authentication measures; overload, flooding or pinging the API);</p>
        <p>you shall not transmit or otherwise make available any material that contains a software virus or any other computer code, files, or programs designed to: (i) interrupt, destroy, or limit the functionality of any equipment (including software and hardware), or (ii) spy on the activities of others;</p>
        <p>you shall not use the API in a manner that, in Equifax’s sole discretion, exceeds reasonable request volumes, constitutes excessive or abusive use, or otherwise fails to comply with or is inconsistent with these Terms;</p>
        <p>you shall not use the API in any manner to stalk, harass, invade the privacy of, or otherwise cause harm to, any person or entity;</p>
        <p>you shall not use the API in any manner that exposes Equifax to any harm or liability of any nature;</p>
        <p>you shall not use the API in any manner that disparages Equifax or its products or services, or infringes any Equifax intellectual property or other rights;</p>
        <p>you shall not use the API or display related content in a manner that could reasonably imply an endorsement, relationship or affiliation with or sponsorship between you or a third party and Equifax, other than your permitted use of the API under the terms of the MTA;</p>
        <p>you shall not make any representations or warranties about the API to any third party; and</p>
        <p>you shall not use API in violation of any international, federal, state, domestic or local law, rule or regulation, whether now existing or enacted in the future, or in any manner that would cause Equifax to violate any such laws, rules, or regulations.</p>
        <p>Data-Related Restrictions. The above license is also subject to the following restrictions regarding the Data:</p>
        <p>you shall only design an application to present the Data in response to an individual query (i.e., you may not design an application in a manner that allows the presentation the Data in bulk format);</p>
        <p>you shall not provide access to any portion of the Data to any party without the prior written consent of Equifax;</p>
        <p>you shall use industry best practices to prevent the misuse of, and unauthorized access to, the Data;</p>
        <p>you shall not use any robot, spider, site search/retrieval application, or other device to retrieve or index any portion of the Data, or permit any third party to do the same;</p>
        <p>you shall take reasonable precautions to prevent caching, indexing, storage, redisplay or other persistence of Equifax data through any means other than as specifically intended and approved by the proposed application;</p>
        <p>you shall not design an application that allows or facilitates the use of the Data in any manner related to credit granting, credit monitoring, account review, insurance underwriting, employment, background screening or any other purpose covered by the Fair Credit Reporting Act (or its equivalent as applicable in the relevant jurisdiction);</p>
        <p>you shall not design an application that allows or facilitates the use of the Data as a derivative database to verify, confirm, enhance, audit, update, or develop any files, products, or databases owned, licensed, or marketed by other companies;you shall not make any representations or warranties about the Data to any third party; and</p>
        <p>you shall not design an application that allows or facilitates the use of the Data in any manner to stalk, harass, embarrass, invade the privacy of, or otherwise cause harm to, any person or entity.</p>
        <p>API Key. You will be assigned a unique key that is associated with your API account (the “API Key”). The API Key enables your application to access and use the API on a nonexclusive basis. All calls to the API made by your application must include your API Key. You must keep your API Key confidential and you may not share it with any third party. You will use only a single account to request an API Key from Equifax. You are solely and entirely responsible for all uses of the API occurring under your API Key. You will not misrepresent or mask either your identity or your API end user's identity when using the APIs or developer accounts.</p>
        <p>Technical Restrictions.</p>
        <p>Periodic Cap. Your use of the API is limited to calls to the API over a given time period as outlined in the chart below. If you exceed the Throttle Rate (as defined below), the API will temporarily stop working for you. If you exceed the limit on more than one (1) occasion, your access to, and use of, the API may be permanently terminated. Equifax reserves the right to change these limits and caps at any time in its sole discretion.</p>
        <p>Throttle Rate. The rate at which the API may be called (the “Throttle Rate”) has been set as shown in the documentation. You will not attempt to circumvent any technical measures we may put in place to enforce the Throttle Rate. Equifax reserves the right to change the Throttle Rate at any time in its sole discretion.</p>
        <p>Export Compliance. Recognizing the global nature of the Internet, you agree to comply with all local and domestic laws, rules and regulations, including laws about the Internet, data, email, export and privacy. You specifically agree to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations regarding the transmission of technical data exported from the United States and the country in which you reside. Such API usage may be subject to the Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”) administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce and regulations administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) and thus may not be provided to or used by any person in any countries that are subject to comprehensive economic sanctions under the EAR, OFAC, or Israeli regulations, which currently include Iran, North Korea, Cuba, Syria and Sudan, as well as Iraq and Lebanon (the “Sanction Countries”). Moreover, any and all API usage by any person or entity that is subject to U.S. or international sanctions regardless of location is prohibited.</p>
        <p>Violations. If you become aware of a breach of any part of these Terms by you, you shall take immediate action to remedy such violation, including notifying Equifax of such violation at the address set forth below.</p>
        <p>Fee for Use. At this time, the API is offered and provided without charge; however, Equifax reserves the right to implement a fee and payment terms for use at any time in its sole discretion. In addition, accounts that are not used for thirty (30) days or more may be disabled at Equifax’s discretion.</p>
        <p>The Data. The Data accessible via the API may be changed, updated, or deleted without notice for any reason at Equifax’s sole discretion.</p>
        <p>Future Versions. Equifax reserves the right to release subsequent versions of the API and to require you to obtain and use the most recent version within ninety (90) days of the release. Failure to obtain and use the most recent version may cause a suspension of access to the API</p>
        <p>Availability/Support. Equifax will, in its sole discretion, use commercially reasonable efforts to provide access to the API to you twenty-four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week subject to normal and emergency maintenance downtimes, but it shall not be responsible for any disruption of the API, regardless of length or cause. Furthermore, Equifax shall not be liable and shall be held harmless for all (whether direct or indirect) losses or damages, costs, penalties, fines and/or expenses you may incur due to any errors or omissions in the Data, or due to your inability to access the Data due to disruption of the API. Your sole remedy for breach of this section shall be to terminate these Terms.</p>
